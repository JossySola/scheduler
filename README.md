I thought of this project after I realized the managers in my current job (*retail store*) were struggling with schedule planification as we are more than 40 employees.

The issue arises as each employee has unique requirements and needs. That is what each row and column specification is for.

This fullstack web application handles `authentication`, `authorization`, as well as `fetching/inserting data` from/to the database through `API endpoints` while also utilizing `Server Actions` for form submissions.

It configures a `middleware` to manage requests to handle *internationalization*, and redirection if the user has a session active.

Furthermore, the application uses external APIs such as `Sendgrid` and `Emailjs`.
